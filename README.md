# Guess the Number by Leonardo Pinna

## Important premise

This project is VERY simple, and the main goal of the development of the app is to learn Python3 and Pygame while exploring functionalities. So, do not expect rocket-science complexity in this project. Also, I will upgrade the code to reduce computing resource usage (for example, removing the rendering of static elements every frame).

## Description

Welcome to the Guess The Number game, developed by Leonardo Pinna (me). This game is very simple: I (the computer) will choose a random number from 1 to 100, and you have to guess the number with a trial and error approach! HAve fun watching my reactions to your answers!

## How to start playing

Right now, the only way to play this game is to download the package and from the terminal run

```
cd <repo-folder> && python3 ./src/main.py
```

to launch the main.py file.

Note that the current version of the game needs Python3 to be installed in your computer!

## Suggestions

If you notice any bugs, or want to suggest improvements, feel free to contact me! I do not expect many messages, as it is all very simple, but I will be very happy to get in touch with you!
